README for Advanced Gastric Cancer Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Resistance Risk Calculator
What the Project Does
This project is an R Shiny-based web application designed to assess the drug resistance risk of patients with advanced gastric cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). It integrates clinical parameters (e.g., tumor differentiation, lymph node status, CEA levels) to calculate a personalized risk score, providing clinicians and patients with actionable insights for treatment planning. The calculator is validated using a systematic review of 25 clinical studies and external cohorts, ensuring robustness and clinical utility.
Why the Project Is Useful
1.Scientific Foundation:
oBuilt on a Meta-analysis of 25 clinical cohorts, synthesizing evidence on NCT outcomes and risk factors.
oFeatures a weighted scoring system derived from Î² coefficients of significant prognostic factors (e.g., age, CEA, clinical stage)
2.Clinical Impact:
oEnables preoperative prediction of chemotherapy resistance, guiding tailored treatment decisions (e.g., surgery timing, adjuvant therapy selection).
oReduces reliance on subjective assessments by providing an objective, data-driven risk stratification (low/medium/high/extremely high risk).
3.User-Friendly Design:
oIntuitive interface with dropdown menus for rapid input of clinical variables.
oInstant risk assessment and clear visualization of results, streamlining workflow in busy clinical settings.
